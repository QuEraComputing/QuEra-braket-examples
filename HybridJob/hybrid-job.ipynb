    "In this example we pass our parameterized pulse program into a classical optimizer in order to provide classical feedback for the next quantum program to run. The use case we will cover here is a pretty standard problem that maps very neatly onto the AHS architecture implemented with Neutral atoms. Because of the Rydberg blockade effect the ground state of a collection of atoms maps exactly to what is called the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on geometric graphs. The MIS problem is a graph coloring problem where the goal is to find the largest set of nodes in a graph such that no two nodes are connected by an edge. This problem is NP-hard and has many applications in scheduling and resource allocation."

    "While this is a lot to take in let us go through some important things. Firstly, you can generate a `Report` object from a Bloqade batch of tasks. This object provides some basic analysis methods common to neutral atom AHS. The one we make the most use of here is the `bitstrings` method which return a list of arrays that contains the shot results after executing the program. It takes a boolean argument that specifies whether or not to return the bitstrings of shots where there were atoms that did not successfully get put into position before the computation was executed. By default this filter is applied, but for this problem we want to include those shots in our analysis hence the `False` argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that our cost function not only contains the `mean` energy but also the standard deviation. The reason for this is because we are targeting an eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian which has no energy variance. This is a good way to check if the system is in the ground state. We use the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean energy as a stopping condition for the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have a callback function that is called after each iteration of the optimizer. This is where we can log the progress of the algorithm. We use the `Tracker` object to track the cost of the quantum tasks that are being executed. We also use the `log_metric` function to log the mean and standard deviation of the energy as well as the cost function of the quantum tasks.\n",
